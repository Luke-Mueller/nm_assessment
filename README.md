## Thanks for Looking

This project was made using Next.js as a Javascript framework and material for styling.  It is my first project using either one.  I chose Next.js because it solves SEO problems that React has and allows me to implement routing and some server-side code out of the box.

The api key was left in the code because Next.js insures it will not be exposed to clients. When deployed, this app would likely allow the host to deal with key storage.  I wanted it to be available so you would not have to generate your own.

This project represents a day and a half of work.  It could use improvement, however, it is a good representation of my work within a limited time-frame.  I would liked to have deployed it and tested it more thoroughly.

Feel free to contact me for help setting up the project on your machine. I look forward to discussing this with you and hope to talk soon.

Thanks,

Luke
